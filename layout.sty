% All margin dimensions measured from a point one inch from top and side
% of page.  Dimensions shrink by about 2 percent

% DRIVER MARGINS: change these to shift the complete page image as a whole
% on the page without modifying the layout

\voffset        0pt      % does not have to be -0.65in  since topmargin is -ve
\hoffset        20pt

% SIDE MARGINS:
   \oddsidemargin  -0.1in   %  Note that \oddsidemargin = \evensidemargin
   \evensidemargin -0.1in

% VERTICAL SPACING:
                         % Top of page:
\topmargin -30pt         %    Nominal distance from top of page to top
                         %    of box containing running head.
\headheight 12pt         %    Height of box containing running head.
\headsep 25pt            %    Space between running head and text.
% \topskip = 10pt        %    '\baselineskip' for first line of page.
                         % Bottom of page:
\footskip 40pt           %    Distance from baseline of box containing
