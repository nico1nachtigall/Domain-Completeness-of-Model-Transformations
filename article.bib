	objects only, where the notion M-adhesive category is short for weak
	adhesive high-level replacement (HLR) category. We call an object
	finite if it has a finite number of M-subobjects. In this paper,
	we show that in finitary M-adhesive categories we do not only have
	all the well-known properties of M-adhesive categories, but also
	all the additional HLR-requirements which are needed to prove the
	classical results for M-adhesive systems. These results are the Local
	Church-Rosser, Parallelism, Concurrency, Embedding, Extension, and
	Local Confluence Theorems, where the latter is based on critical
	pairs. More precisely, we are able to show that finitary M-adhesive
	categories have a unique E-M-factorization and initial pushouts,
	and the existence of an M-initial object implies in addition finite
	coproducts and a unique E0-M0-pair factorization. Moreover, we can
	show that the finitary restriction of each M-adhesive category is
	a finitary M-adhesive category and finitariness is preserved under
	functor and comma category constructions based on M-adhesive categories.
	This means that all the classical results are also valid for corresponding
	finitary M-adhesive systems like several kinds of finitary graph
	and Petri net transformation systems. Finally, we discuss how some
	of the results can be extended to non-M-adhesive categories.},

abstract="Model transformation is one of the pillars of model-driven engineering (MDE). The increasing complexity of systems and modelling languages has dramatically raised the complexity and size of model transformations as well. Even though many transformation languages and tools have been proposed in the last few years, most of them are directed to the implementation phase of transformation development. In this way, even though transformations should be built using sound engineering principles---just like any other kind of software---there is currently a lack of cohesive support for the other phases of the transformation development, like requirements, analysis, design and testing. In this paper, we propose a unified family of languages to cover the life cycle of transformation development enabling the engineering of transformations. Moreover, following an MDE approach, we provide tools to partially automate the progressive refinement of models between the different phases and the generation of code for several transformation implementation languages.",

The solutions have been compared with respect to several criteria: correctness, conciseness, understandability, appropriateness, maturity and support for extensions to the core migration task. We describe in detail the comparison method, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the solutions with a special focus on the differences between graph and model transformation for model migration. The comparison results demonstrate tool and language features that strongly impact the efficacy of solutions, such as support for retyping of model elements. The results are used to motivate an agenda for future model migration research (including suggestions for areas in which the tools need to be further improved).",

ABSTRACT = {Model transformation plays a central role in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and supporting bidirectionality is a current challenge with important applications. Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) are a formally founded, bidirectional model transformation language shown by numerous case studies to be promising and useful in practice. TGGs have been researched for more than 15 years and multiple TGG tools are under active development. Although a common theoretical foundation is shared, TGG tools differ considerably concerning expressiveness applicability, efficiency, and the underlying translation algorithm. There currently exists neither a quantitative nor a qualitative overview and comparison of TGG tools and it is quite difficult to understand the different foci and corresponding strengths and weaknesses. Our contribution in this paper is to develop a set of criteria for comparing TGG tools and to provide a concrete quantitative and qualitative comparison of three TGG tools.}

abstract="Model-driven engineering and model-based approaches have permeated all branches of software engineering to the point that it seems that we are using models, as Moli{\`e}re's Monsieur Jourdain was using prose, without knowing it. At the heart of modeling, there is a relation that we establish to represent something by something else. In this paper we review various definitions of models and relations between them. Then, we define a canonical set of relations that can be used to express various kinds of representation relations and we propose a graphical concrete syntax to represent these relations. We also define a structural definition for this language in the form of a metamodel and a formal interpretation using Prolog. Hence, this paper is a contribution towards a theory of modeling.",

abstract="In November 2000, the OMG made public the MDA{\texttrademark}initiative, a particular variant of a new global trend called MDE (Model Driven Engineering). The basic ideas of MDA are germane to many other approaches such as generative programming, domain specific languages, model-integrated computing, generic model management, software factories, etc. MDA may be defined as the realization of MDE principles around a set of OMG standards like MOF, XMI, OCL, UML, CWM, SPEM, etc. MDE is presently making several promises about the potential benefits that could be reaped from a move from code-centric to model-based practices. When we observe these claims, we may wonder when they may be satisfied: on the short, medium or long term or even never perhaps for some of them. This paper tries to propose a vision of the development of MDE based on some lessons learnt in the past 30 years in the development of object technology. The main message is that a basic principle (``Everything is an object'') was most helpful in driving the technology in the direction of simplicity, generality and power of integration. Similarly in MDE, the basic principle that ``Everything is a model'' has many interesting properties, among others the capacity to generate a realistic research agenda. We postulate here that two core relations (representation and conformance) are associated to this principle, as inheritance and instantiation were associated to the object unification principle in the class-based languages of the 80's. We suggest that this may be most useful in understanding many questions about MDE in general and the MDA approach in particular. We provide some illustrative examples. The personal position taken in this paper would be useful if it could generate a critical debate on the research directions in MDE. ",

Both presuppose the existence of conceptualizations as ways of conceiving the world {\textquotedblleft}in certain delimited ways.{\textquotedblright} But high-level programming languages also function as models of virtual (or abstract) machines, while low-level programming languages function as models of causal (or physical) machines.

  abstract = {Abstraction is the most basic principle of software engineering. Abstractions are provided by models. Modeling and model transformation constitute the core of model-driven development. Models can be refined and finally be transformed into a technical implementation, i.e., a software system. The aim of this book is to give an overview of the state of the art in model-driven software development. Achievements are considered from a conceptual point of view in the first part, while the second part describes technical advances and infrastructures. Finally, the third part summarizes experiences gained in actual projects employing model-driven development. Beydeda, Book and Gruhn put together the results from leading researchers in this area, both from industry and academia. The result is a collection of papers which gives both researchers and graduate students a comprehensive overview of current research issues and industrial forefront practice, as promoted by {OMG}'s {MDA} initiative.},

abstract = "We present a broad extension of the conventional formalism of state machines and state diagrams, that is relevant to the specification and design of complex discrete-event systems, such as multi-computer real-time systems, communication protocols and digital control units. Our diagrams, which we call statecharts, extend conventional state-transition diagrams with essentially three elements, dealing, respectively, with the notions of hierarchy, concurrency and communication. These transform the language of state diagrams into a highly structured and economical description language. Statecharts are thus compact and expressive—small diagrams can express complex behavior—as well as compositional and modular. When coupled with the capabilities of computerized graphics, statecharts enable viewing the description at different levels of detail, and make even very large specifications manageable and comprehensible. In fact, we intend to demonstrate here that statecharts counter many of the objections raised against conventional state diagrams, and thus appear to render specification by diagrams an attractive and plausible approach. Statecharts can be used either as a stand-alone behavioral description or as part of a more general design methodology that deals also with the system's other aspects, such as functional decomposition and data-flow specification. We also discuss some practical experience that was gained over the last three years in applying the statechart formalism to the specification of a particularly complex system."

  abstract = {State machines can be comprehensively specified, simulated and validated at design time to get a formally founded skeleton for a software application. A direct implementation of state machines in Java source code can realize states as classes, transitions as methods and variables as well as pre-conditions and variable updates as auxilliary methods, invoking either arbitrary application methods to retrieve the current variable values or evaluating expressions [1]. Viewed from an abstract level, implementation and state machine are two models, sharing the same semantics. To maintain the modelled software systems, it is vitally important to perserve as much of this semantics as possible in the source code to be able to track back changes and errors [2,3]. In contrast to these considerations, current techniques of model-driven development use several unidirectional steps, starting from an abstract model and resulting in platfrom specific source code.},

	Based on Triple Graph Grammars - Extended Version},
  institution = TUB,
  year = {2010},
  number = {2010/08},
  abstract = {Triple Graph Grammars (TGGs) are a well-established concept for the
	specification of model transformations. In previous work we have
	formalized and analyzed already crucial properties of model transformations
	like termination, correctness and completeness, but functional behaviour
	- especially local confluence - is missing up to now. In order to
	close this gap we generate forward translation rules, which extend
	standard forward rules by translation attributes keeping track of
	the elements which have been translated already. In the first main
	result we show the equivalence of model transformations based on
	forward resp. forward translation rules. This way, an additional
	control structure for the forward transformation is not needed. This
	allows to apply critical pair analysis and corresponding tool support
	by the tool AGG. However, we do not need general local confluence,
	because confluence for source graphs not belonging to the source
	language is not relevant for the functional behaviour of a model
	transformation. For this reason we only have to analyze a weaker
	property, called translation confluence. This leads to our second
	main result, the functional behaviour of model transformations, which
	is applied to our running example, the model transformation from
	class diagrams to database models.},
